#Squad - Your way to making happy teams

##Why Squad

We all know group projects in school were the worst...why do we keep making the same mistakes in the work place? Chances are, you've worked with a peer on a project before and chances are..you'll be asked to work with them again. What if you want to explore other options? What if the last project didn't go so well?

Say you're a project manager and you're forming all these squads. You want to make them productive, but you also want them to be content with who they're working with.

Squad can consolidate anonymously submitted information from 'Members' to make sense of their preferences in order to be best matched in teams requiring a set of skills to get a project done.

NOTES: This is a WIP, more instructions and code to be shipped.

##Who is a Squad Member?
A squad member is anyone who will be working on a team together. Each member will have to fill out their preferences for each member in their Squad Pod.

Squads can belong to a number of Pods. You might have ones for random side projects or one for work.

##What is a Squad Pod?
Think of a Squad Pod as the umbrella, like a department. The Pod consists of all associated Squad Members and 'assigns' teams.

##Who is a Pod Leader?
The Pod Leader is the administrator for the Pod. They are responsible for clicking the button to 'Create Squads', add additional Squad Members to their Pod, as well as list their primary skills.
